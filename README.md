# FarkleMonteCarlo
Monte Carlo score simulation of Farkle, the dice game.


Recently was taught about the game of Farkle, so I made a Monte Carlo simulation
to find out what the average hand value is. The program (main.py) assumes you
continue rolling until a farkle. Average score per hand is ~570.
